Construct.txt
====================
This file describes how Peer1 and Peer2 were constructed.
1. Create an empty solution in your working directory
1. Add C++ windows console applications Peer1 and Peer2.
2. Copy the folder CppCommWithFileXfer from Project2HelpF2018 or 
   from Handouts\Repository\Cpp\CppCommWithFileXfer.
3. Load the projects for FileSystem, Message, MsgPassingComm, 
   Sockets, and StringUtilities.
4. Build them all as static libraries
   - make sure you change TEST_PPP to noTEST_PPP in 
     Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions
5. Make references to all of them in your Peer1 and Peer2 projects.
6. Now add code in the Peers to send and receive messages and
   files.
7. This demo shows the results of doing that.
